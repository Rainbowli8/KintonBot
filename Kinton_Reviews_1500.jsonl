We called ahead to ensure if their kitchen is still open, and we were assured by one of the workers that they can take last call orders by 10:10 pm. We were greeted and seated very promptly as soon as we got in. We made sure to order right away, being mindful of their closing staff. Food came in hot and quick and we were able to enjoy it accordingly. Service 5 out of 5.\n\nWe had an order of Takoyaki for a shareable started and it came very hot & looking very appetizing. Taste and texture definitely did not disappoint. For our mains, we ordered one Chicken original and one Pork Original ramen. Presentation is very simple yet very appealing. I appreciate their bowls that have chicken and pig logos appropriating the different meats used for the ramen. I also like the wooden utensils giving a very authentic Japanese feeling. The ramen broth was rich and creamy, noodles and egg were cooked perfectly and the meat was tender and flavourful. Only big negative for me is the meat to bowl ratio, since there were only two slices of pork / chicken in each bowl. Food 4 out of 5.\n\nThis establishment is set in a prime location of the North York area. The interiors have modern design yet feels very cozy. Place is clean ans well maintained, from the dining area, opem kitchen and washrooms. Only negatives I would say is that there is limited space especially for seating. The seats and tables look pleasing to the eyes however felt uncomfortable as you sat on them especially as we ate dinner. I felt like I hsd to constantly adjusting, finding the most comfortable position to enjoy my food. Atmosphere 4 out of 5.","reviewDetailedRating":{"Food":4,"Service":5,"Atmosphere":4},"likesCount":1}

I would have liked the ability to choose/upgrade the side dish as the citrusy sweet glaze slathered on the gyoza ($4.50 by itself) is not for me. In general, Kinton‚Äôs dumplings aren‚Äôt the greatest; after scraping off the sauce what‚Äôs left is bland, the filling lacking texture and flavour.\n\nIn the mood for some heat, the pork spicy garlic ramen ($12.95 for just the noodles) certainly hit the spot ‚Äì right to the back of the throat as you sip the flavourful fragrant broth. The thick noodles went perfectly with it and stayed chewy despite not being consumed right away.\n\nIn hindsight, the ramen could have used some extra toppings as the base was nothing more than just the garlic, a few slices of pork, and a sprinkling of scallion. I would have like something crunchy, like bean sprouts, and a mound of sweet corn to balance out the spice. Note to self: add-ons are key.\n\nMy husband was on the right track elevating his bowl with the karaage pork original (additional $3.50 with the combo; $16.45 for just the noodles). I assumed it would be a soggy bust, but the four thick pieces of crispy pork still had a bit of crunch and was oh so juicy. Even as it sat in the broth and the batter soaked in the creamy pork soup, it still tasted good. Way to go Kinton, this karaage ramen is delicious!","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

I don‚Äôt write review often but this time I just couldn‚Äôt stop myself from sharing this. This is the picture of a $20 bucks Raman noodle that I ordered from Kinton. Two super thin pork slices, which one of them is nearly all fat. Noodle is super dry and tasteless, we could blame the delivery period for the dryness, but the taste and flavour is just like boiled in the plain water. Seems like Kinton Ramen needs a better recipe for the soup base.\n\nI get it with all the inflation, restaurants barely survives from increase of expenses. But making noodles like this will only accelerate the speed of the closure. $20 can easily get me a bowl of Ramen with 4-5 thick, juicy charsu in NY area.

Clientele seem relaxed and happy, enjoying their food.

The lighting, the interior design, the overall vibe and friendly atmosphere completely relaxed me, before I even had sat down.\nThe staff are extremely friendly, polite, and respectful, and are willing to completely customize your dish, which I find very good since ramen in some beliefs can be used to help cure sickness or be relaxing, and toning down spiciness or removing certain meats , etc, help achieve that goal.\nThe restaurant is phenomenally clean each time we go, and even in the plating that arrives to our home with ordering online. The tables are spotless, there is practically a shine like gems from how well sanitized they are, especially noticed during the harder waves of covid. The plating of the food, the presentation, etc, is everything and more with my expectations. And one KEY NOTE that I find important to note is even from different locations, online ordering, and from in person dining, NEVER has the food tasted different or less authentic, dry, cold, wet, soggy, flavourless etc. They also have less unique options of ramen, which I find great because myself, I'm not a fan of seaweed or unfamiliar ingredients in my food, which is why my absolute favourite ramen to order is the Chicken Shoyu with thin noodles. At the same time they do have a world of flavour palettes within their menu, so I recommend looking through, and finding the best one to fit your style, which is definitely one of the reasons I can't stop supporting and buying meals from this restaurant. For those who enjoy a good heart-warming bowl of ramen with a friendly, welcoming environment and an overall soul-cleansing dining experience, I highly recommend going to a nearby Kinton Ramen, or this location. I would recommend if for seasoned ramen enjoyers, beginners, novices, children, teenagers, adults, elders, and anyone who just enjoys restaurants with an authentic and true representation of their business and an overall five star place.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

Yes it's that bad. The quality has dropped to basically zero. If I can give a zero star I wouldn't hesitate to do so. The soup is definitely powder based. Even my korean instant noodle soup taste better than this. No more authentic, flavorful, and thick Japanese bone soup anymore. Shame. The noodles are tasteless and not the same quality of thin ramen I had before. It came in all dried up and clumped together like a pudding. Terrible. The chicken breasts are paper thin and obviously overcooked. Even my home made chicken breasts are a lot more juicier. I paid extra for more chicken but doesn't look like I am getting more. Wth? Overall really disappointed and horrible I won't even call it ramen. More like instant noodles to me. Or even worse. The food quality is just unacceptable and doesnt match with their price at all. For $20 there are a lot better ramen places in Toronto. Or just get yourself an instant noodles. Don't waste your time and money.

As I was eating, I noticed an odd colour and shape in my bowl and thought it was a bamboo shoot, which should not be out of the ordinary. I continued to put it in my mouth and the texture was very soft and then I noticed it was penne pasta. I decided to ignore it  and not put up a fuss as I was with my kids. As I continued to eat and getting to the bottom of the bowl there was a few more pieces and at this point I was pretty disgusted as it seemed as if no one washed the bowl and just reused the bowl with remnants from the last customer (which is pretty confusing as this is a Raman restaurant and not a pasta restaurant).\n\nI asked the waiter why penne pasta was in my food and he said \"oh it could be when they were packaging the noodles, some might have fallen in at the manufacture, but let me go and ask someone else\". To me that seemed plausible, but highly unlikely. After a few minutes, another person came to us and he explained that they used the same water to cook the staff meals as the ones they use for the noodles and there was some left in the water - this was also a plausible explanation and I was satisfied with the explanation, but every unsatisfied with the eating experience.\n\nThe same person indicated that they were willing to give us 1 free appetizer from their summer special menu as compensation for what had happened. I looked at him with amazement and smiled and said \"sure\" - while the whole time I was in disbelief how he insulted my intelligence in the whole matter (to add context to the situation, the summer special was $1 menu items and his tone was a little condescending). To be honest, I didn't know what to expect, maybe covering my meal (not the whole table) would be enough compensation, or maybe a simple apology would do.\n\nAt this point, I am very disappointed with this location and I hope all other locations are not following the same practices in processes and procedures when it comes to cooking staff meals/food that's not offered on the menu. This was truly an unsatisfying meal.","reviewDetailedRating":{"Food":1,"Service":1,"Atmosphere":3},"likesCount":0}

The staff split our group in half by seating us at 2 separate tables that were far away from each other, which wasn't great. Another thing to note is that none of the chairs have back support, so if you're wearing a bag or coat you will have to put them on the floor or leave them in your car. I ordered the pork shoyu ramen which tasted alright but it didn't come with an egg. Other ramen restaurants I've been to include an egg in the ramen but Kinton requires customers to pay extra if they want one. Overall, I probably won't go back to Kinton because there are other ramen restaurants in the GTA that provide better service and food for your money.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

Both soups are very flavorful and the taste was passed into the noodles which we both enjoyed very much.\nThe only turn off is that menu photos are usually never the same as the dish served and sometimes the main feature, in this case for mine was the beef. It was a bit small as compared to the menu.\nMy original plan for my rating was 4 stars but after hearing about my friends bad experience I had to change my rating.  A friend that is in a Facebook Food groupd of over 12,000+ members ate there not too long ago and had the same bowl I had, she had asked the wait staff why the beef is not the same size of as in the menu photo?  The answer was that the angle of photo made it look bigger???  If that was true, I would love to met to hire this photography to make anything 2 times the size that it should be LOL. I'm not professional photographer but no one can make anything look twice as big.  As for my beef in my bowl, it did not cover a third of my bowl.\n\nOur overall experience here was enjoyable, $16 price tag for a bowl of soup noodles is in the high end and not the average pice  in my book.\nI think they could have handled this situation a bit better with my friend with the answer she got...","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":2}

Extremely disappointed with what management did here.\n\nI haven't been to the other locations post pandemic, but with this kind of quality I wouldn't bother.","reviewDetailedRating":{"Food":1,"Service":2,"Atmosphere":4},"likesCount":0}

Went to a late lunch early dinner during a weekend day and didn't have to wait for seating. We ordered the spicy garlic pork ramen as well as the shoyu ramen. The order came very quickly. Although the base price of ~$13 is cheap compared to others, you'll have to pay extra for egg or mushroom so the price can add up very quickly. The chashu was very taste, same as the broth. Asked for a less spicy version of the spicy garlic pork ramen which made it more manageable since the raw garlic is pungent and spicy. Really enjoyed the noodles regardless.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

I then realized that I couldn't recall if I had ever had it! So after ample ridicule from the group, we made our way to Kinton Ramen.\n\nKinton is a chain of ramen restaurants, with this particular location in a plaza at Leslie and Highway 7. The medium sized restaurant has table seating with benches, and other tables with stools, so get ready to work on that posture. The browns and blacks of the space give it a mellow vibe, and you'll find the Kinton pig logo emblazoned in the surroundings.\n\nWhen you walk into the restaurant you may or may not notice people yelling for no immediately apparent reason. After sitting for some time, you'll notice that upon the arrival and departure of anyone to & from the restaurant, the chefs hollar out some sort of greeting or farewell. It's a fun, yet confusing touch that may amuse you or entice you to yell back. Your choice.\n\nWe started with sides of edamame, karaage (Japanese style fried chicken), and takowasabi. The edamame was fine, and the karaage was nice, but I was nudged to fandom by that God send takowasabi. The name of the dish instructs you that you are intended to use the small sheets of seaweed to create a taco with the zesty octopus & wasabi stem mixture. I loved being presented with a lively sweet flavour, and then just as I thought I had a handle on things, being slapped with a hit of wasabi heat. And believe me, they don't play around with that serving of wasabi. They're fighting the good fight against under-seasoned food!\n\nAs for my possibly first ramen experience, I kept the spicy party going with their spicy garlic pork ramen. The ramen is served in a sizeable bowl along with a handy spoon/ladle, so no need for the usual noodle slurp-fest. Once you mix the garlic mound into the deep orange broth, you'll enjoy a lightly spicy broth that wonderfully complements the substantial amount of noodles swimming below. It's a little bit of a shame that the pork itself didn't quite meet the deep and comforting flavours of the rest of the bowl. I didn't get the sense that it was all that fresh. Regardless, I ate happy that day.\n\nI encountered a well appreciated touch when I went to the bathroom and saw the decor. They keep to the dark walled theme, and you'll find that Kinto pig even in there, etched into the mirror. They've also got tooth picks and mouthwash in there. So feel free to bring a date, devour that spicy garlic ramen, and still leave fresh.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of this place. The food is great, and the simple decor is purposeful and well thought out. I could personally do without the staff yelling at me, but if that's the price of good ramen, count me in.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

Today's experience was not as pleasant as before. We ordered a few bowls and needed to add extra noodles for a 4yr old vs ordering a full bowl for him but we did not expect them to put the noodles in the spicy soup base for myself vs putting them in a separate bowl.  What was upsetting was when I asked the staff if they added the noodles in the bowl vs putting them separately their response was you should have asked to have it in a separate bowl and simply suggested I order another extra noodle which we did in the end... Also to mention the wait time for the food was extra long... Now to the taste, the soup barely covered all the noodles in my bowl (could be because of the extra noodles) but for me, the soup base is very important and it really should be much more than the noodles itself plus tasting like alkaline water is definitely a turn off... Asked for the bill in advance because there was only 3 wait staff and took me awhile to get someone's attention and after getting the bill, I wanted to wait for the kids to finish before paying but they seemed rush to collect... So overall it wasn't a pleasant experience and probably will go back to other ramen joints...","reviewDetailedRating":{"Food":2,"Service":2,"Atmosphere":2},"likesCount":0}

Soup comes separate from noodles/toppings - you pour the broth over when you're ready to eat. Everything is microwaveable so if you don't want to eat it in the car (I did, no regrets) it will still taste freshly made after warming up and then mixing. Gyoza were super crisp for takeout.

We had the pork shoyu and the spicy garlic pork ramen, both were absolutely stunning bowls with a rich soothing broth that was packed with flavour. The broth was very well developed and a drop spilled on the table quickly solidified into jello, a testament to the gelatin content they've achieved. We also ordered the karaage to try, which was also quite good.\n\nSomething special about Kinton is their Kinton Bowlers system, which I find both amusing and fascinating in equal measure. The first bowl of ramen you finish to the last drop will prompt your server to ask if you'd like your picture taken for the bowler club. Your response must be yes. If you say yes, the whole kitchen staff (in the beautiful open kitchen) and serving staff grab props and pose with you and your first finished bowl. The team quickly returns to their original roles and the picture is uploaded to the Kinton Instagram page, finally you will be handed a button pin and a card. The card is for tracking your lifetime Kinton bowler points (finished to the last drop by one person), and overall the experience is very fun even if it ends there but the idea of returning and building up points to get rewards is a fun way to try all the different bowls they offer!\n\nOverall I'd be thrilled to return to this restaurant, it made for a great date night.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

We came in around 2:00pm and there were seats available, however after 20 mins, the restaurant was starting to fill up. Their menu offers a good selection of ramen flavors with 2 protein options; pork or chicken. They also have a vegetarian option and their specials that are only around for a limited time. Usually you order by choosing the flavor/protein and with thin or thick noodles. They also have the kinton combo where you can order a ramen and side dish for $4.\n\nThe ramen came fairly quick (around 15 mins), and it was time to dig in. I got the Pork Shoyu ramen which was very flavorful, albeit being a little salty. The thin noodles were nice as they are less springy and more chewy compared to thick noodles. I tried the Original Pork broth which was drastically different from the Shoyu. I would describe it more to be on the creamier side even though it‚Äôs sea salt based. Both were delicious, however I find the broths are abit salty as we were very thirsty afterwards.\n\nI would recommend Kinton as they are one of the few brands that tastes pretty close to what you‚Äôd get in Japan!\n\nIG: Ayenomz","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

I know alkaline noodles may be faintly bitter sometimes, but this was very noticeable and completely overpowered the flavour of the broth. We ordered thick noodles, but they felt undercooked, and my bowl had clumps of noodles still stuck together. Not sure if the thin noodles are any different, but I cannot recommend the thick ones if this is how they are normally served. The pork slices were thick and pretty flavourless, and sadly they inherited some of the bitterness from everything else.\n\nThe side dishes we ordered, however, were very enjoyable (takoyaki, spicy karaage, pork donburi, tofu furai).

However, that doesn't detract from the quality. I had the cold ramen and I can't recommend it enough.

The bowl I had seemed very small in the picture, but was actually rather large depthwise. I would recommend this restaurant if you don't mind paying a little bit extra compared to, say, pho. However, one major inconvenience was the lack of backs on the chairs, so you had to hang your coat on a packed hanger in the winter, and you have nowhere to put a sweater in the summer. This is more due to the cultural decor, but still somewhat annoying.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

It was super hot when we went and was really pleased to see 3 cold noodle options. It was so fitting for the heat so we got the Chilled Tsukemen which reminded me of cold soba. It was really good. Full of sesame flavour, and included two slices of pork shoulder, shredded Nori, and a seasoned egg cut in half. It also includes a dip, green onions, and wasabi. The only wish I had was that they included more wasabi - but that's more like an individual taste thing. We also go their pork miso ramen which is always comforting and I topped it off with grated garlic and bamboo shoots. The soup was flavourful but slightly salty for my taste and the garlic added a nice slightly spicy touch to the broth. I opted for thick noodles as always and it had a very good \"chewy\" texture. Definitely really pleased with the cold ramen option. I hope it stays because I'll definitely order again.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":4}

Bar none the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced in a restaurant, to the point where I was rushing my meal just so I could stand up and leave. Basically just a small wooden stool, with no back support and no padding. If you are above 5'8 and above average weight, I sincerely believe you should avoid this restaurant.

Kinton, Kenzo, sansotei and Ajisen. Out if those 4 Kinton is by far my favourite. They actually have spicy ramen which I love. Their portions are standard size but the flavour profile has more of a punch. I love the ball of minced garlic they top their bowls with. I have tried both their pork bowls and their chicken. Even the chicken is very tender and soft. Food wise I can find nothing to complain about. Service wise I would say it is mediocre. Usually when I go there I expect to be sitting for about 15 mins before someone actually comes up and takes my order. I'm not sure why all the employees there seem so busy. They are very nice and pleasant but I dont want to be sitting 15 mins to place my order, especially when it's clear we are ready to order. I had to stare and smile at 3 waiters and none of them got the hint. Then I flagged someone down and they said \"someone will be right with you\". A little frustrating but I guess it's worth it.

They must've ran out of broth - we waited 30 minutes for them to take our order, then another 20 for our sides to come out, finally our ramen came 15 minutes later (Waited over an hour for the ramen). It usually takes other locations around 10 minutes to take your order MAX and the dishes are out around 10 minutes later. Once we got our dishes, they were extremely bland. I ordered the spicy garlic and it tasted like noodles in lightly salted water. The eggs were overcooked as well. Won't be returning to this location.

You should give it a try if it's something you may like, it's a seasonal item as well. I do not recommend the Gyoza as the portion to price ratio is not worth it at all. Unfortunately, we were done with our meal and waited a long time to gain the attention of our waiter and receive our bill. They were fairly empty as well so I don't understand why it took that long.

We liked the nice eating environment, high ceilings, cleanliness of the restaurant, and spaciousness compared to the tighter spaces in the downtown locations we usually frequent.\n\nHowever, we were extremely disappointed with the slow service. The servers were friendly but very inattentive, making what we should have been a quick eat into a 2 hour ordeal. First, it took us a while to get a server to come take our order, which was entered into an iPad. We placed our order around 8:50pm and waited over 30 minutes before our food came out. Meanwhile, the 2 tables next to us and behind us who either arrived a little before/after us and had all gotten their food, eaten, and left while the table by the window who arrived after we placed our order had already gotten their appetizers and noodles. When we asked a server whether our order got placed properly, we were told that it was delayed due to them being busy and a 'slow internet connection'??? but were assured that it was coming soon. I suppose our table must have been in a 'dead zone'...\n\nWhen the food did come, it was really good. We shared an order of takoyaki and each ordered the dinner combo which included a bowl of ramen, 2 chicken karaage, 2 gyoza, and a slice of cheesecake. The takoyaki was delicious - cripsy on the outside and steaming hot and moist on the inside. The noodles were the perfect al dente texture and broth was tasty. The karaage chicken and gyoza did not disappoint.\n\nAfter we were done our meal, we probably sat for a good 15 minutes before the cheesecake came.

The chicken, pork and soft boiled eggs did not arrive warm. The yolk of the egg was in fact still cool. The major downside to the bowl of ramen is actually the noodle. They were slightly on the hard side, not the bounce and chewyness of other noodle stores. These noodles snap when you bite into them. On the bright side, the spicy karaage had a gentle yet firm heat and good acidity in the sauce, and the chicken was cooked to perfection.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

I alternate between the regular and Spicy Karaage, depending on the weather or my cravings. I would say that their Karaage is definitely in the top 4 of my list when it comes to ramen joints appetizers. For their ramen, I always get the Shoyu Pork ramen. I have tried other ones like Pork Spicy Garlic and Karaage Pork on occasion. They all tasted great.\n\nThe space in this location is massive. I rarely had to wait for seats anytime I drop in. They have plenty of table seating and high table seating facing the kitchen.\n\nOne downside, or improvement, I would like to mention is that the service can be better. It‚Äôs hard to wave down a server to get their attention. Especially when asking for water. Given that it‚Äôs a salty and normally hot broth, I tend to drink lots of water. But their cup is a small metal cup and doesn‚Äôt hold too much water. This might be a personal issue that I‚Äôm nitpicking but easy access to cold water would be appreciated.\n\nOverall, I always enjoy my time here and would definitely recommend this place to fill any ramen cravings.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

Its seems that they just top it with a hotter broth. Oh boy! Taste is super different from how they make it before.\n\nAlso, the seasoned egg on my other other was cold. They gave us two new ones but it is not any different. According to the staff who attended us, they make it and store it in the fridge. When its time for use, they will toss it in a boiling water and serve. Not too impressed with the answer. Yolk is not runny and tastes bad! See photo attached.

The thin noodles sure do taste better than the instant noodles. I usually end up getting twice the amount of noodles. The downside is they only serve you two small pieces of pork. I wish they would give a little more.\n\nThe gyoza pork dumplings are absolutely wonderful. Fried golden brown, very crispy, nice and hot on the inside. The sauce compliments the dumpling perfectly.\n\nThe only reason I did not give this a 5/5 star is because I had severe food poisoning one time I‚Äôve eaten here. I was sick for 5 days with diarrhea.

We decided to go with the  Chicken\nMiso & the Vegetarian Ramen, both with thick noodles.\n\nThe Chicken Miso, was good, but I was hoping it would have a little more flavour to it.\n\nThe  Vegetarian Ramen was good, but it wasn't out-of-this-world delicious. The portion size was HUGE, so big that my sister could barely finish the bowl.\n\nBoth dishes also lacked spice, but our server brought us some chili flakes and srirachi to help with that.\n\nLastly, as we got ready to leave, all the staff shouted goodbye to us in Japanese.\n\nOverall, it a was a great first experience, I wasn't blown away by the dishes, but I wouldn't count it out the next time I'm craving Ramen.\n\nThe great service is really what make the experience memorable.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

The first Kinton was downtown which I loved visiting as a university student, and Scarborough was severely lacking in great ramen places, so I was happy when this place opened up years ago. I always get their shoyu ramen, and I would include add-ons like seasoned egg, bamboo shoots, and corn. Their karaage is fresh and goes well with the sauce, but sometimes a little salty. The gyoza also tastes good and goes well with the sauce. I love the black sesame cheesecake, but sometimes they are not freshly cut (has stiff or chewy edges).\n\nEverything is 5 stars except service, which I gave 4 out of 5 because of the way they receive takeout orders. The person who wrote the order forgot to put our order in. After telling the person our order (and its the right oerson because she also took other people's takeout orders), my bro and I left to go somewhere expecting to come back with our orders done, but when we came back, we had to wait an additional 20 mins for our orders to be done.

Since I hanged out in all different ramen restaurants around GTA (specially downtown Toronto area), I trust myself to make judgment wether it‚Äôs better than normal or below standard ramen. Atmosphere is good, open space and looks bright and clean. Staff as previous reviewers stated, cheerful. The waitress found me a sit efficiently and I ordered the the location special. I did it because it printed on the menu as shown on my picture, it should be one of the best selling ramen in the restaurant. It should represent around the best ramen quality in the restaurant if I was not mistaken. I don‚Äôt think we should focus on the ramen  noodle too much because we all have different preferences. I always taste the soup first because if it‚Äôs good ramen you gotta have a decent tasty broth base. I found it‚Äôs too salty...after finished the full bowl of ramen I had to drink a glass of water to ease my thirsty. Pork belly and others were good but I disagree with previous reviews that stated ‚Äúoutstanding ‚Äú, perhaps I was too picky or my expectation was too high. Compare to other ramen places their price is alright, nowadays on average a bowl of decent ramen costs about $16, so I think it‚Äôs fair. Overall, if you are in Scarborough area and desperately looking for a bowl of ramen, Kinton is you best bet. Ranking Kinton align with other ramen restaurants I would give them 3.5 stars, not that they lack of quality, just didn‚Äôt impress me.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

The quality is slightly different that downtown but not worse. The chicken slices on the chicken Ramen is smaller than downtown. I asked them if they have the same meal deal as downtown (with a 4-piece gyoza, etc. For $2 more) and the girl looked at me puzzled.

We were able to be seated and served a lot more efficiently in the Yonge location even though they are a smaller location.\n\nDidn't even get to try the ramen due to poor customer service. The person waiting the tables was very inconsiderate especially to a family with a toddler and could not realize how these seats could easily accommodate 2 and a toddler so she instead allowed 5-6 groups go ahead of us. It wasn't until I got upset that they suddenly had a table available but at that point My wife and I were upset. Not recommended for families. It's a shame because I've been an advocate to your brand and as a lover of ramen, this bad experience Left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n-Just an update, since then is has been a bit better as I really want to be able to enjoy myself at this location","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":2}

I go there on a monthly basis with my fianc√©. But last night put me in a sour mood about this location to be specific. I went in for dinner and stood at the door entrance for quite some time. The host didn‚Äôt acknowledge me at all. The line started to go out the door and still chose to ignore me. All I wanted was to be put in the waitlist to be seated and so did the others behind me. I finally poked at the host to ask if I can get a table for two in which he said to give him a minute and he walked away. I waited some more and then he came back and decided to take peoples orders and dealing with Uber or whatever. Then I and a gentlemen behind me asked to be put on the waitlist too and then again. He said sure but did nothing about it. Didn‚Äôt ask for my name, my number or anything to confirm I‚Äôm on the waitlist and proceeded to walk away from us again. I got frustrated so I left. I decided to go to Kinton on Yonge and they treated me the way a customer should be treated. They sat us down, served us water, took our order, food came out quick and delicious and everything was great. The only downfall is that I had to pay for parking and it was far away from my house. The Kinton at William Kitchen Rd is slow, their customer service takes forever, food sometimes doesn‚Äôt come out consistent. Anyways, I‚Äôll give Kinton at William Kitchen Rd one more chance.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

Clearly they need to revamp their ordering system.\n\nThe staff was friendly and nice when I mentioned I was there for pick up. He was basically running inside and out taking people's dine in orders and figuring out people's take out orders. I feel there should be another person to help out somehow.\n\nMy chicken karaage was deep fried too long, resulting it tasting rather tough, plus it was cold. Same with my pork gyoza, it was also cold and deep fried too long.\n\nMy original pork ramen looked a little sad in the bowl. I feel like they have taken out a lot of ingredients. The broth was delicious, hot and hearty though. Though a little watery.\n\nThe matcha cheesecake was light and yummy even though the slice was smaller than I had pictured.\n\nOverall, I would not be ordering take out from this location anytime soon as the quality is a little hit or miss and the wait time is ridiculously long.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":2}

We ordered takeout the week of August 21st and it seems they either recently changed the pork spicy garlic broth recipe, changed the cook, were too busy to uphold quality, or have watered the batch we received down significantly. We were really disappointed with our last order. My brother even ordered the garlic oil in his bowl and they charged him for it but didn't seem like they added it because there was nothing written on the container.

You‚Äôll enjoy the Ramen, gyozas and whatever else you order.\n\nI gave this place 3 stars because of the service. If you‚Äôre going at peak hours, be prepared to wait for a long time. I know this is a bit of the norm in COVID, however, it extends beyond that.\n\nBefore going into it, I‚Äôd like to note that the issue is not the staff, but the system in place. I ordered online, with a suggested time of 30 minutes wait. No problem! I arrived at the 30 minute window, expecting the food to be ready or almost ready.\n\n3 times the staff assured me that the food was no more than 10 minutes behind, however I ended up waiting over 30 minutes for a standard listed menu item. To make matters worse, I was sent away with the wrong broth.\n\nAgain, I‚Äôm not hating on the staff, but I think Kinton needs a system that allows their employees to no feel so pressured, as well that reflects more accurate wait times. I would‚Äôve been happy to wait at home the hour and change that it took for the food to arrive, instead it was frustrating to be strung out the extra time.\n\nAgain, this is a first world issue, and not major in the grand scheme, but it‚Äôs helpful to know if you‚Äôre planning to eat at Kinton, be prepared to wait longer than expected.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

We witness some of this chaos!  A few tables having to get their bills corrected.  Thankfully, we didn't have that experience.\n\nOne review mentioned the sun shining into the restaurant.  This definitely needs to be addressed!  The restaurant faces west ... on sunset ... it was really warm in the restaurant.\n\nAs for the food, it was okay.  Would I got there again?  Maybe at a time when the place is less busy ... so there would be no confused orders and faster service on the drinks.  BTW ... the food arrived before the drinks!","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

Turns out the waitress misheard me when we asked for two of them instead of one. They did make an effort to make it better by bringing the second ramen within 5-7 minutes and offering a drink on the house (it was a nice gesture but I just opted for ramen).

You come in, sanitize your hands, and then fill out a form with 1 person of your party's information on it, and then they seat you. Once you sit down you scan a QR code which is supposed to spring forth the menu onto your phone. It didn't work for me so I had to look for their menu online and ordered through there. They also ask once you're seated if you'd like disposable or regular cutlery. The whole time I'm wearing my mask but I saw a few not wearing theirs at times while talking. Of course when you're eating/drinking you don't need to wear one, especially if you're eating/talking is fine, but just put it back on once you're finished.\n\nCame here yesterday with a friend to have some ramen, and although service and sanitizing practices were great, the ramen itself could use a bit more refining. Had ramen at other places before and this one is just okay to me, nothing really amazing stands out in terms of quality or flavour but I mean for $12.95 you do feel full afterwards without the need for appetizers.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

I ordered the shoyu pork ramen and it only had two measly mediocre pieces of pork at $12.99. Added extra veg which was $3.50. None of which are worth their price. Tried ordering a green tea and it took twenty minutes and had to ask three different servers. They approached the guy beside me about the tea. Once she clued in I told her to cancel the tea. Then she goes back there and brings me the tea that just I canceled. That's just dumb.\nThey're dumb, they're food and prices are dumb and you're dumb if you like this place because you're getting ripped off. With their cheap ass ingredients (like how much are noodles by the bowl really? Like ten cents. Especially if they are buying it in bulk or making it in house.) they are making a killing off of customers that don't know any better. I hope a better place opens up and wipes them out because they suck the big one.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":3}

On the positive side, the restroom is well-kept, and everything else seems fine. Unfortunately, they've removed the tofu nuggets, which used to be a personal favorite of mine.

A senior staff member, who appeared to be in a position of authority, demonstrated a rather perplexing attitude towards late-arriving customers. It was close to 9 pm, and as per the official website, the restaurant's closing time was indicated as 10:30 pm. To our surprise, upon arrival, we found the large table near the entrance area already cleared and chairs turned upside down, seemed that specific area was after its opening hour at that period LOL.\n\nWhen we requested a table for three adults, we were informed that only two four-seat tables were available, both of which were currently occupied. The Japanese lady who seemed to be a senior staff member, conveyed that we would need to wait for approximately 30+ minutes to be seated at a larger table, despite the restaurant not being particularly crowded at the time.\n\nSensing the availability of numerous two-seat tables, we proposed splitting up and occupying two smaller tables. Strangely, the senior staff member seemed reluctant to accept this solution, insisting that we wait for the larger table. It took some persuasion on our part to eventually be allowed to take the smaller tables.\n\nWhat baffled us even more was the subsequent actions of the senior staff member. She welcomed a single customer and directed him to share one of our small tables without a word of explanation or consideration. This decision was bewildering, as there were still vacant two-seat tables in the restaurant.\n\nUpon inquiring about this unusual arrangement, the japanese lady provided no valid explanation and simply turned away from us. Her demeanor shifted from courteous to distant, leaving us perplexed and somewhat unwelcome.\n\nOverall, KINTON offers remarkable fare and friendly service. However, an unexplained incident involving the senior staff muddied an otherwise enjoyable experience. For those seeking authentic Japanese ramen and a mix of flavors and quirks, KINTON still holds promise, but be ready for an unexpected twist.","reviewDetailedRating":{"Food":4,"Service":2,"Atmosphere":3},"likesCount":0}

It‚Äôs literally a 5-minute walk from where we are staying in Toronto.\nService is typical of that in a good Japanese ramen place - which means you are welcomed loudly and cheerfully, and led to your seats swiftly. Ditto for when you are done and exiting the place.\nKinton Ramen serves two kinds of soup base - pork and chicken, neatly categorised into columns listing variations of each. Noodles are also available in thin or thick options - yay to choice!\nPictured above is my order of the ‚ÄúChicken Spicy Jalape√±o‚Äù with thin ramen ($13.50) into which I added a Seasoned Egg ($2). The broth was ultra smooth and thick, close to creamy even and very concentrated in chicken goodness. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the innocent looking pale hue, it hides the slow, steady burn of jalape√±os that mean business. The large pieces of chicken breast meat were tender and moist, not at all stringy. Cooked al dente, the ramen had a lovely bite - exactly how I like mine to be.\nMy parents shared a bowl of Pork Spicy Garlic ramen and enjoyed it very much too. That broth packed a different but equally potent spiciness.\nDo order the baked Matcha Cheesecake for dessert.

Kinton ramen is one of my all time favourite restaurants. My first time, I thought the bowl was really cute and offered to pay the waitress for a couple. She told me the only way was to earn it. Not with my cash, NO, I had to pay the RAMEN PRICE! 100 polished bowls and it‚Äôs all mine. After eating and slurping the stuff I thought ‚ÄúWell okay,challenge accepted!!!‚Äù Its so fricken good. The broth is smooth, and complex with it‚Äôs own unique taste. The thin noodles are my personal favourite and the first thing I‚Äôll polish off. The pork is delicious but sometimes fatty which Probably adds to the soups flavour. Everything in there works so well together. A perfect concert in a cute little pig bowl. Thank you Kinton Ramen for being so consistently awesome. Looking forward to bowl #65!","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

I corresponded with the Kinka Family's service email and they informed me that their operations manager would be in contact with this location. I was not told to revise or to remove my review.\n\nToday (August 19th) at my wife's insistence that I give this place another chance, we decided to give this location one more try. We were promptly seated, given water (that were pre-filled - smart idea) immediately, and the waitresses were nothing but courteous and informative during dinner service. We even got water refills today - no refills for anyone on August 11th evening.\n\nI respect Kinka Family's willingness to listen and to act on customer feedback.

We didn‚Äôt have appetizers this time so the Ramen was with us less than 10 minutes after ordering.\n\nSpace-wise, there seems to be less shared seating than the Queen St West location. A large table near the entrance that could seat perhaps 10 people and then smaller 2 and 4 tables and bar-seating which overlooks the restaurant. Some of the seats towards the back of the restaurant are kind of close to the bathrooms (less than 2 meters away).\n\nOverall, really solid, tasty and consistent ramen location.

The menu says that despite taking precautions there may be trace amounts of gluten, a sentence usually used to clarify there may be cross-contamination in the kitchen that is not completely gluten-free. Today, an unusually responsible waiter showed us all sauces say ‚Äúcontains wheat‚Äù, so ALL ramen has gluten in it.

Came with six slices of pork, so regular meat = two slices.  Extra noodles was a generous portion and if you're hungry definitely get it!\n\nGyoza had a wonderful sweet and spicy sauce!\n\nChicken karaage was just excellent!!  Four large pieces still steaming hot from the fryer!  Be careful, but so yummy!\n\nThe decor was cozy, with peripheral tables as well as bar seating.  Metal tables and wood stools.

There was no mistaking the texture of noodles bought from the Loblaws across the street from this location.\n\nAnd thirdly, when I mentioned this to my server, he first said it was because i ordered the thick noodles, which, according to him, have a different consistency from the thin noodles. I said I've always ordered the thick noodles and know exactly what they're like, and that this was not it. Then, my server continued to lie to me by saying that due to the minimum wage increase, the owners had changed the noodles.\n\nI really don't appreciate being lied to and treated like I'm stupid, especially by the staff at a restaurant chain I like so much I got my kids into liking it as well.\n\nFolks, do NOT go to the Eglington location.\n\nIt's terrible!!!","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}

Craving the delightful dish yet again, I visited Kinton Ramen with my friends.\n\nHoping to try a variety, we ordered 4 different bowls, each with a generous serving of noodles, vegetables and/or meat. Starting with the flavorful veg miso - a divine combination of soybean paste, fried bean curd, bamboo shoots, and vegetables, this nourishing meal was only made better with the other vegetarian bowl of ramen. Chili pepper, fried bean curd, bamboo shoots, and various vegetables - the Veg Spicy Garlic was a masterpiece in spicy flavors, with a light broth and tender tofu making for a delightful meal that was well worth its price. The meat-based bowls - spicy pork and donburi chicken were delights too! Flavored with seasoned egg, sea salt, nori, and scallions, the bowl of Spicy Pork ramen was utterly vibrant with its tender meat! The Donburi chicken was a great side to accompany it, giving a balance of sweetness to cut the spicy flavors. Highly recommended!\n\nTo hear about this review, follow us @eatinontario on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.","reviewDetailedRating":{"Food":5,"Service":5,"Atmosphere":5},"likesCount":1}

Our #1 pick is the Pork Spicy Garlic ramen. What I love about their ramen is you have 3 options for noodles: Thick, Thin, and Shirataki. Shirataki costs extra $, but worth it if you're looking for less calorie, low carb (and less guilt) option. Pork Gyoza and Takoyaki are both great and tasty, but Karaage is a winner for children. For adults, Hot Karaage is a must-try. We recently tried their Beef Donburi, and I can say it's really good. Just the right tenderness, and flavor. I wish Kinton will offer it as a full/meal-size bowl in the future. Place is nice, and lots of natural light. Washrooms are clean and roomy, they even have mouthwash, I guess to wash off all the garlic taste and smell after the finishing a bowl of ramen. Great experience overall.","reviewDetailedRating":{"Food":5,"Service":5,"Atmosphere":5},"likesCount":2}

The karaage chicken on the ramen was cooked perfectly and the spicy garlic tonkotsu was very spicy, and strong in flavour.\n\nThe modern interior design as well as clean tables and well-maintained washrooms contributed to the overall atmosphere of this location.\n\nWe did however notice a contrast between the two visits, as the first one seemed a lot more active with motivated employees. The second visit the employees were still very friendly, but the shouts in Japanese of greetings and good byes seemed less enthusiastic. I don't care much for the greetings for what they are, but since the location is well-known for this environment, it seemed to be a representation of the staff motivation.\nI also noticed that the pork cuts in the tonkotsu ramen were definitely smaller in our second visit. Hopefully they don't keep shrinking...\n\nOverall, the food quality is still great, but demotivated staff might make a place lose it's vibrance in the future - especially for Kinton Ramen.

But overall all of them had a nasty, salty, sweet aroma. As soon as I tasted it I knew the water had been sitting there for ages before I even showed up. Something that caught me off guard was the spicy beef shoyu and how spicy it was. I had this exact order before and it was never this spicy. And to let you know, when ordering the server did NOT let us know that it would cost an additional charge beyond the original set price of 2.

The restaurant is very clean.  The bathroom was very clean.  I loved the little touch of having mouthwash and individually wrapped toothpicks available on the bathroom sink.  The staff working were very attentive, friendly and looked like they were happy to be working there.  That says a lot about a restaurant in my opinion.  Even though we loved it, we won‚Äôt be there often, as the price was a bit high for a lunch.  Perhaps not a high price for what we ordered, I‚Äôm not sure as this was a complete new experience for us.  Perhaps all restaurants of this type are expensive?","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

The Ramen I had was the immune booster and it was really good the flavors came out and the ginger wasn't too overpowering I especially enjoyed how the egg was perfectly cooked a little soft in the middle but not overcooked or under... And I'm glad that they include the egg and not kept it as  an expensive add-on like some ramen places do... The washroom was clean and modern and that's always a good sign as well as the kitchen is in the center of the restaurant so they're not hiding anything they cook everything in front of you... The only thing I would say and I feel this way about most ramen places is that it's quite expensive for what you actually get ,with tax and tip it was $22 for a bowl of ramen I feel that's a little on the steep side that being said I still go and try Ramen time to time fully knowing this going in....

However, to my dismay, the dumplings turned out to be deep-fried with the pork dumplings, making them unsuitable for vegetarians.\n\nThis is very concerning and disappointing, as the menu is misleading and inconsiderate to those with religious beliefs or those following a vegetarian/vegan diet. I hope the restaurant takes action to update their menu and ensure that all vegetarian options are truly vegetarian. Until then, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for vegetarian options. I raised my concern with the staff, but all they did was say 'I will let my manager know.'\n\nThis is not only a matter of misrepresentation, but also a matter of respect and sensitivity towards customers with dietary restrictions.

When we were seated, we used our phones to look at the menu online. The food took a bit longer than expected for ramen, around 15-18 minutes but not too long of a wait considering it was busy. After looking at such positive reviews online, I expected that the ramen would be pretty good.\n\nI got the original pork ramen, I really wanted to see how their original soup tastes. Unfortunately, the broth lacked flavour and depth. It was honestly kind of bland compared to other ramen chains I have tried. In my opinion, the broth is the key to good ramen. The noodles were decent, I opted for the thick ones. The pork slices were small and when I asked one of the waiters why one slice was complete fat they explained that all the bowls come with one pork shoulder and one pork belly (the slice that is fat). I have personally never seen a piece of pork belly that is all fat passed off as a slice of meat so I was very disappointed as I did not want to eat a slice of fat. As well, no where did it say that they would have this differentiation. The waiter said that we could ask for just pork shoulder next time. The best part of the meal was the egg, it was just the perfect yolky consistency. The price point I would say is mid ($13.99), but for the flavour of the broth and ingredients of the ramen I would not say it is worth it. The spicy one is better because it was at least spicy which gave it a little more flavour.\n\nOverall, kind of disappointed but glad I tried it so that I can review Kinton ramen in Waterloo!","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":9}

I pulled out the menu and asked them were it say‚Äôs signature ramens and they proceeded to inform me that it didn‚Äôt say that on the menu but we should have inquired‚Ä¶ here I was under the impression that any ramen would be a signature one. Also if you want a decent ramen don‚Äôt try anything but the spicy ones, I made that mistake and it was very bland and salty.

Overall I‚Äôm not impressed with they way they do business, it‚Äôs only $5 but it‚Äôs more the principle behind ripping off your consumers with false promotional tactics.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":1}

After 32 minutes!!! the spicy garlic came, and it was cold (disappointing, but the flavour was still good). Also, we still haven‚Äôt got water yet‚Ä¶so we asked for water. What really annoys me is that nobody is communicated at all with us while we were waiting, and there was no apology for having waited for so long.\n\nAfter another 3 minutes, a waitress said there was no more ground pork for the golden sesame, and asked us if we were okay substituting it with the pork from the other kind of ramen (sure, no problem). When the golden sesame finally came, it was missing spinach. We asked why there was no spinach and they said they ran out and gave us more bean sprout instead (would‚Äôve been nice to know beforehand like with the ground pork)\n\nTldr: usually this place is great, but that one night with no communication and more than a half hour wait was a serious disappointment.","reviewDetailedRating":{},"likesCount":0}
